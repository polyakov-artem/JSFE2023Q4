     Valid markup of checked page corresponds to the message "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show." In this case, we assign the full points for the checked page (+6). If there are `warnings` but no `errors`, we assign half of the points (+3) for the checked page
   - Favicon is added to each page: **+2**
   - Each page has only one `<h1>` element: **+2**

2. The layout matches the design: **+40**
