## Transcription

Hi, my name is Artem and I graduated from the Academy of Engineering and Economics with a degree in hydraulic and pneumatic automation systems. After completing my studies, I began my career as an engineer. Over time, I rose to the position of Chief Specialist in Hydraulic Systems for Cars. It was an interesting job, but over time I felt that my interests and passion lay in the field of web development. 
I have always been fascinated by computers and programming, and it was around 2021 when I came across a YouTube tutorial on creating landing pages that sparked my interest in web development. From then on, I spent my free time studying the subject, even though it was a small amount compared to my duties. 
In the process of learning, I became familiar with various programming languages and tools that are essential for web development, such as HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass, and Pug. 
JavaScript is an essential part of frontend development, so I pay close attention to learning its basic concepts. I use Sass and Pug to work more efficiently with CSS and HTML, respectively. Additionally, I have become familiar with project builders like Webpack and Gulp, which allow me to automate the development process and simplify the assembly and optimization of my projects. I have a slight understanding of PHP and React, as well. 
Since work takes up most of our time in our lives, I have decided to pursue a career as a frontend developer. Therefore, I am currently taking an online training course at Rs-School.
I strive to create high-quality code, so I adhere to the principles of cleanliness, modularity, and reusability. When completing tasks for RS school, I created separate modules that I could reuse in the future.
In my completed tasks, I have tried to create pleasing and thoughtful user interface, facilitated by the constructive feedback from the reviewers. I am eager to learn more about what the next stage of the course will involve, and to gain valuable teamwork experience, if possible. 
I am committed to developing the skills necessary to become a successful frontend developer. 

Thank you for your attention.
