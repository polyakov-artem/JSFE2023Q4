## Reflections

### Getting Started with TypeScript 
After finishing this module, I learned how to install TypeScript and set up a TypeScript project in VS Code. With static type checking, TypeScript catches issues with your code early on in development, before they can cause problems later. Types also help you describe what you're trying to do with the code. If you work in a team, other members can easily understand your code too.

### Declare Variable Types in TypeScript 
After finishing this module, I learned how to declare variables using primitive types, union and intersection types.
The main thing about TypeScript is that it allows you to add these static types to your JS code. These static types also help to better document what your code is trying to do, which is really helpful for both you and other devs to understand.

### Implement Interfaces in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned how to declare an interface, implement an interface, declare an interface with custom array types.
Interfaces are great for creating short names for common types, describing existing JavaScript APIs, and clarifying function parameters and return types. They also help drive consistency across different objects, because every object that implements an interface operates under the same set of type definitions.

### Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned about writing functions with required, optional, default and rest parameters. I also learned how to define function types with type aliases or interfaces, which helps to prevent you from accidentally passing the wrong value to your function. This is especially important when working with larger codebases or functions written by others.

### Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned a lot about classes in TypeScript. I learned how to: 
1. Declare a new class using TypeScript. 
2. Instantiate the class using TypeScript. 
3. Apply access modifiers (private, public, etc.) to the class. 
4. Define static properties inside the class. 
5. Extend another class by declaring it as a subclass. 
6. Create an interface to define the shape of the object. 
7. Decide when to use interfaces or classes to define an object's structure. 

Classes in TypeScript add a lot of cool features to ES6, like type annotations and access modifiers. They also let you specify required and optional parameters for your classes.

### Generics in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned about generic functions, interfaces, and classes. I also learned about implementing generic constraints. Generics lets you tell functions, classes, and interfaces what type of data they should accept when you call them. That's great if you want to create a component that can work with a variety of different types instead of just one.

### Work with External Libraries in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned all about how to organize code with modules and import external types in TypeScript. TypeScript allows you to import libraries in a similar way to how you'd import modules that you've created yourself. Once you've imported a library and its type definitions, you can then use it in your own code and take advantage of things like IntelliSense and type checking.

### Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript
After finishing this module, I learned about single-file namespaces and multi-file ones. When you're using a namespace, all the code inside it is taken out of the global scope and put into the namespace instead. This can be really helpful because it helps reduce the amount of code that's in the global scope. It also helps reduce naming conflicts and makes it easier to reuse code.
